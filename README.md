# Sticker Frames #

## About ##
Sticker Frames adds 2 types of Item Frames that render their contents flat (like a sticker). The 2 variants are:
-   **Sticker Frame** (Flattens the normal item frame render but flat)
-   **Gui Sticker Frame** (Renders the flat GUI render of the item)

There's also Glow variants of both which just render the item full-bright.

Once an item is in the Sticker Frames the frame itself will not render.
